# learning-rust
Learning from the Rust programming language book


### Disclaimer
If you ever come across this, don't judge me the code is probably very bad, I'm learning. I don't even know what to do with rust, just learning for learning sake and recent hype. Might comeback few months later to evaluate my progress
I might even stop learning rust if I don't find it interesting again. So take note that the code is full of beginner level incompetence
